# Team A

## Instructions Part 1

Your team of expert Lego builders have been tasked with creating a model house. Your clients requirements are listed below. You have creative freedom to make the house in any style you wish. A roof and a floor should not be built.

The house needs to consist of at least 3 rooms (Pick):
- Kitchen
- Bathroom
- Bedroom
- Lounge room

Each room needs to contain a set of furniture specific to that room:
- A bed and two bedside tables
- A couch and coffee table
- A kitchen bench and stove
- A bathroom cupboard and toilet

The house should contain a door, and windows in 2 of the 3 rooms. Walls should be at least 3 bricks high.

Your team will have just 20 minutes to build your model house and make it ready to present to your client. Take some time to organize your build with your team:
- What will your design be?
- Who is working on what parts?
- Who is keeping an eye on the time?

There are a limited amount of bricks, if you need more or different bricks you will need to trade with the tables around you. You may need to be creative in how you build.

## Instructions Part 2

Your fellow lego builders have been working on a house design for a client. Unforeseen events have left the project in your teamâ€™s hands. It is now up to your team to alter the design based upon the client's feedback.

Upon seeing the first iteration, the client realized the original design is missing some flair. The client has suggested some ideas that may add flair to the design. They have asked you to build at least 2 of the following:
- A garden with a pond
- A garage with a vehicle
- A master bedroom with a bed and side tables.

Your team will have just 15 minutes to complete part two and ensure the design is completed. Take the time to read through the Part 1 instructions to make sure your team understands the original requirements. The first team may not have had enough time to complete the original plans. 

Make sure that all the tasks from Part 1 and Part 2 are completed.
