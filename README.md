# Lego Ice Breaker

The exercise is designed to be a bit of fun while allowing participants to build collaboration and practice communication skills. The goal of the exercise is for teams to create a model based on a set of instructions and then maintain/improve another teams model based. There are two parts of the exercise, with instuctions for each part. Teams should receive instuctions for 1 part at a time. Teams of 8-10 people should be split into 2 sister teams (Team A and Team B). These teams will swap onto the other team's project halfway through and receive the second part of the build instructions. 

The whole exercise should take just over an hour to complete.
